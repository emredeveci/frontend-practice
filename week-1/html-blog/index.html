    <h2>A Divination Problem</h2>

      room, she never puts out that fire," said Ron as they started up the
      staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor. He was quite right.
      The dimly lit room was swelteringly hot. The fumes from the perfumed fire
      were heavier than ever. Harrys head swam as he made his way over to one of
      the curtained windows. While Professor Trelawney was looking the other
      way, disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an inch or so and
      settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played across
      his face. It was extremely comfortable. "My dears," said Professor
      Trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and
      peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes, "we have
      almost finished our work on planetary divination. Today, however, will be
      an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for he is placed
      most interestingly at the present time. If you will all look this way, I
      will dim the lights..."

    <h2>Is Dobby Finally Free?</h2>

    <p>
      "Ah, no, Harry, how come you didn't spot that?" said Ron, grinning over
      from his own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping paper. "Tell you
      what,
      <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Dobby" target="_blank"
        >Dobby</a
      >
      - here you go - take these two, and you can mix them up properly. And
      here's your sweater." He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just
      unwrapped, and the hand-knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent, Dobby
      looked quite overwhelmed. "Sir is very kind!" he squeaked, his eyes
      brimming with tears again, bowing deeply to Ron. "Dobby knew sir must be a
      great wizard, for he is Harry Potter's greatest friend, but Dobby did not
      know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless -"
      "They're only socks," said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the
      ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same. "Wow, Harry -" He had
      just opened Harry's present, a Chudley Cannon hat. "Cool!" He jammed it
      onto his head, where it clashed horribly with his hair. Dobby now handed
      Harry a small package, which turned out to be - socks.

    <h2>Dumbledore Asked Calmly</h2>

      "Hermione, where are we going?" Harry asked, after she had led them down
      through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the
      entrance hall. "You'll see, you'll see in a minute!" said Hermione
      excitedly. She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried
      toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the

      had regurgitated his and Harry's names. Harry had never been through here
      before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but
      instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led
      to Snape's dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor,
      brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were
      mainly of food. "Oh hang on.." said Harry slowly, halfway down the
      corridor. "Wait a minute, Hermione..."
